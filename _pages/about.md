### About

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Graduate School of Data Science](https://gsds.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), and currently been advised by [Mun Yong Yi](http://kirc.kaist.ac.kr/people_director.html) as part of [KIRC](http://kirc.kaist.ac.kr/) (*Knowledge Innovation Research Center*). My research interests are in developing and applying deep learning-based systems to assist and improve the fields of healthcare, visual recognition, and cognitive science.
